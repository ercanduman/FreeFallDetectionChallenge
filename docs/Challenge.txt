# Android Engineer - Challenge (Free Fall Detection)

## Specification

* Create an Android library that detects a free fall of the device. In particular, the program should be able to differentiate a free fall from other kinds of device motion, like shaking, rotating, and moving.
* The detection should also work while no user interface is in the foreground.
* The app should display a list of detected free falls (duration and timestamp).

## Bonus tasks

* When a free fall ends, the library should store the event with its duration in a database of your choice.
* When a free fall ends, the library should display a notification.
* The library should provide a method to retrieve a list of all stored events.

## Other considerations

Feel free to use Java and / or Kotlin to implement the specification.
